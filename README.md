# Final Project Initial Brainstorming
---
### Idea \#1 ###

#### Overall ####
Provide a platform for fitness gurus, personal trainers, athletes, etc. to meet potential clients that would like coaching in a specific area.

#### Inspiration ####
Twitter fitness community - many people looked to regular people with a perceived high amount of training for coaching. These coaches used twitter to provide online and offline coaching/training and advice

#### My Users ####
People are have a fitness skill or certification. People who are looking to get trained/coached in a specific area or field

#### Features ####
-Account: Allowing the user to keep track of their past interactions and connect with others
  -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
  -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
  -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
-Profile Survey (on initial setup/login): Who are you looking for? What skills do you have? Skill level? What are you looking to improve?)
  -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
  -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
  -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
-Search: specific people, specific skills
  -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
  -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
  -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
-Transaction: Trainers should be able to sign up for a monthly membership and clients should be able to pay for services along with a small transaction fee
  -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
  -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
  -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
-Location: Clients should be able to find those closest to them.
  -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
  -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
  -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH

### Idea \#2 ###

#### Overall ####
This application will be for DIY-ers and renovators. It will provide them with them with the space and organization that they need to get their projects done faster and more efficiently.

#### Inspiration ####
As a DIY-er myself and the daughter of one I have seen the mess it can breed. The most organized person can lose track of a project quickly. It starts as an idea in your head. You might jot a few notes down on a sheet of paper, then another one and another and by then you've lost the first one with the overall goal.

#### My Users ####
My users will range in age and capabilities but they will also have a range of projects. My aim is that it will be easy enough for the simpler, smaller projects, but in depth enough to allow for more complex projects.

#### Features ####
Do a 3 part rating (priority/impact/mystery) for each feature.
  -Account: Allowing the user to keep track of their past projects
    -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
    -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
    -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
  -Search w/Location: Users should be able to use their location to find the closest trades for a project (i.e, plumbers, electricians, full contractors, etc.)
    -_*PRIORITY*_: LOW
    -_*IMPACT*_: MED
    -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
  -Photo Upload: Users should be able to upload a "Inspiration", "To-Do" (Before), and "To-Done" (After) photo to show off what they've done. Which should be allowed to be shared socially (Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram)
    -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
    -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
    -_*MYSTERY*_: HIGH
  -Budget Tab: Users should have a tab within their project for budgeting. It should have an 'expected costs' and 'actual costs'
  -Materials Tab: Users should be able to keep a list of materials they need to purchase for the project
    -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
    -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
    -_*MYSTERY*_: LOW
  -Tasks Tab: Users should be able to keep a list of tasks they need to complete for the project. The tasks should be able to reorder, set priority, delete and edit.
    -_*PRIORITY*_: HIGH
    -_*IMPACT*_: HIGH
    -_*MYSTERY*_: LOW

### My preferred choice ###
My current favorite is number one. However I recognize the scope of the project and may have to be more realistic.


---
### Organization Plan ###
I will be very careful to plan out my days. I will be using my Google Calendar along with Quip. I will also be utilizing the Pomodoro technique, along with taking the 5 minute breaks to keep my mind clear.
I am really good at visualizing what needs to be done and being realistic about the time it will take me. I can easily shut out the outside world and get zoned in.
While I am good at getting reset I struggle sometimes with hitting a wall and taking too much time trying to stay zoned in versus taking a break and getting the help that I may need.


---
### Tech Stack Plan ###
1. What stack will I use?
Both will be React Native applications. Testing will be done using Jest and Enzyme.

2. Finally, if you see any specific technological or learning barriers that you see in your project, please indicate what they are and why you believe them to be barriers. These are often very similar to your high risk ratings features. Please explain why you see these as particularly risky or if you do not have any high risk items, please explain how you came to that decision.
  I will have to learn how to create accounts which will be the biggest hurdle. I think the other parts of the application will be relatively low-risk.
